        "\n",
        "### a. **Selected Project Track**\n",
        "\"I chose the track on **Context-Aware Language Translation** for my Minor in AI project. This project aims to tackle the problem of regional and contextual nuances in automatic language translation systems.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### b. **Clear Problem Statement**\n",
        "\"In India, where multiple languages and dialects exist, automatic translation systems often fail to capture the subtleties of regional language usage, tone, and context. Traditional models focus on word-for-word translation but miss out on idiomatic expressions, cultural references, and informal speech patterns. This project aims to design a **context-aware translation system** that handles these regional nuances.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### c. **Real-World Relevance & Motivation**\n",
        "\"Context-aware translation systems have real-world applications in various sectors such as customer support, legal document translation, social media, and multilingual communication. By improving the accuracy of translations, we enable more effective communication across linguistic boundaries, which is particularly important in a multilingual country like India.\"\n",

        "## b. Dataset Limitations\n",
        "\n",
        "## \"The dataset used includes publicly available parallel corpora, but it may not cover all regional dialects or specialized domains like medical or legal translation.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "## c. Responsible Use of AI Tools\n",
        "\n",
        "## \"It’s important to use AI translation systems responsibly, particularly when dealing with sensitive content. Misinterpretation or cultural insensitivity could lead to harm, so human-in-the-loop verification is suggested.\"\n",
